# Realmeye webscraping

## About
This is a realmeye webscraping module that has been created because the one I previously used got shut down and other api's and webscraping modules did not cover the criteria I have. It currently is still a work in progress, but feel free to fork it and adjust it to your needs.

## How to implement
The code in `index.js` should be copied and pasted into a custom javascript file that you want to call the function from. The code will return a json object, string or a array depending on the function you call.

## Required packages and libraries
* Node.js - To run the code
* Axios   - To retrieve a website from the internet
* Cheerio - To convert the website to html elements

## Disclaimer
This project has been made for personal use, feel free to fork it and adjust it to your own needs, but keep in mind that it might not comply with your personal needs.
